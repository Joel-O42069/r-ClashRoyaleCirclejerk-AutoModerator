comment: "I think I am sexually attracted to B-rad. He is the most handsome and sexy Clash Royale YouTuber. His videos are so entertaining I could watch them all day. I could jerk off to his voice. Oh, how it's so hot. He is without a doubt my favorite YouTuber of all. His content is so unique and creative and I wish I could watch his videos forever. Whenever I see his face I get turned on and I get really hard. I wish I could meet him in real life so I could cuddle with him on my bed. We would take turns beating our meats with my massager. I know I won't be able to meet you in real life, but I just want to tell you I love you with a burning passion. Please respond to me at the very least so I have something to beat my meat about. I am your number 1 biggest fan and I hope you know that. Leave your wife and go out with me. I love you B-rad."

   "Holy shit i want to pound the shit out of the archer queen asshole. I just get so hard looking at her. I would let her shoot arrows into my dick hole and have her cut my dick off and smush it into a soup and make me drink it just to get a little nibble of her pinkie toe. I literally cannot sleep because i just cant stop jerking my dick to her. Holy shit i think already i busted 20 times while writing this. She is just so fucking hot. I cant go to school without having to jerk off in the bathroom. I have to do my homework while jerking off. I get cum all over my paper.

   I have done countless cum tributes to archer queen, i even have a fan game where you fuck her until she dies. I want her to come out of clash royale and just stomp my dick into the ground. I would be her toilet forever if i could just see her dirty stinky feet and make her rub it all over my face. I am a pig and her feet are piles of mud.

   I cant play my favorite game clash royale because every time she spawns I instantly cum everywhere. I try to hold it back but i cant. I would suck every goblins dick in the goblin gang just to have her shit stained feet be rubbed all over my dick and my face.

   Holy shit i dont know how much longer i can go anymore. I used to have my girlfriend dress up as the archer queen and have her shit all over me while jerking my dick with her stinky feet but it just wouldnt be the same. She broke up with me and now i have no one to cosplay as the archer queen. At least my archer queen flesh light is still with me.

   I seriously think about just killing that stupid barbarian king. He is getting to fuck her every minute while im here with a dick drenched in cum. I fucking hate him. He gets to lick her feet. I DONT. This is not fair. I will smash his skull into the ground and take the archer queen and have her queef all over me. I would never shower again to keep the smell of her queefs on me.

   I would cut off the archer queens feet so i could turn it into a flesh light and have it jerk me off every second of my life. God it would be so hot. Just her stinky little piggies rubbing all over my cock. I would be the hog, and her feet would be the rider."

comment: "Should i uninstall clash royale? Currently, im stuck at 1600 trophies with no deck building skills and a knock off hog 2.6 cycle i got off someone in this subreddit. Almost every single round i lose and i get bmed, even when im being a normal player. The gamee has started to affect my mental health, my day was perfectly fine before i laid on my bed and opened clash royale. Every time i get bmed theres no f2p emote that tell the opponent that hes being excessively toxic, not even a text that asks “why”. And then i start to think negatively about myself and have suicidal thoughts. The only reason i want to keep this app installed is because it is a part of the clash universe. I feel like i cannot play clash of clans without having this game with it too."

comment: I'm shaking. I'm fucking shaking. I’ve never wanted to breed with anything more than I want to with Sparky. That perfect, curvy body. Those bountiful coils. The child-bearing chassis of a literal goddess. It honestly fucking hurts knowing that I'll never mate with her, pass my genes through her, and have her birth a set of perfect zappies. I'd do fucking ANYTHING for the chance to get Sparky pregnant. A N Y THIN G. And the fact that I can't is quite honestly too much to fucking bear. Why would Supercell create something so perfect? To fucking tantalize us? Fucking laugh in our faces?! Honestly guys, I just fucking can't anymore. Fuck. - Bounding_Bandit

comment: |
   go and cry, elder of petro canada, you are extraordinary, and not in the way you would think. The amount of things you are able to achieve despite being the absolute most terrible player in the game clash royale really does astound me. 

   For example, you were able to reach challenger 1 although your reaction time and game knowledge hardly surpasses that of someone in Frozen peak. You also were able to be promoted in a popular clan to the rank Elder, even though your brain matter has started to deteriorate at a permanent and alarming rate. Further more, you had the audacity to post a replay of you relying on luck with an inferno dragon to nearly win a match where you were losing to an underleveled player. what was this kid thinking? what were you thinking when you decided to build your deck? what were you thinking when you decided to voluntarily embarrass yourself in a clan you represent with the most horrendus plays ever known to man? 

   Your username, being toxic and all, is ironic, being that you probably lose most matches and end up having to give your phone to someone competent enough to win with your slimy phone. Reaching challenger 1, but never climbing as leagues don't have a safety net. I already knew this clan was becoming terrible, when multiple clan members get kicked and demoted for no reason, and how this clan loses clan wars, (how?) but seriously, this elder that was allowed to even be in petro canada was the last straw. Please uninstall clash royale, and i recommend everyone in this clan leave. Good riddance."

comment: "The year is 20XX. Everyone uses Mega Knight decks at TAS levels of perfection. He is the only viable tank in the game. Because of this, the winner of a match depends solely on a set of RPS games. The Rock Paper Scissors metagame has evolved to ridiculous levels due to it being the only remaining factor to decide matches. Humanity has reached its pinnacle. The Cycle and Bait peasants are living in poverty. It seems nothing can stop the great leaders of 20XX,  The Mid Ladder army, and the Mega Knight monks who live in great monasteries where they levitate while TASing Mega Knight placements with one hand, and winning GCs with the other. The Clash Royale metagame has gotten to the point where all Mega Knight placements and interactions are played out to theoretical perfection, so tournament goers just play Rock Paper Scissors to decide matches, and that’s the game."

comment: mirror is just being used by bad, braindead players to get easy or cheesy wins. And due to the fact that you only face Level 16 cards when going against a mirror it's hard to tell what kills what, how much damage they deal, if they crown tower will finish it, etc. Supercell just keeps adding annoying, broken dumb shit to the game making it more and more infuriating to play. Bring Mirror back down to Mirroring level 15 cards or better yet, JUST REMOVE IT FROM THE GAME. The card is literally broken and makes no sense right now.

   message: UH OH! Greedy Cash Royale mods require you have a total of 70 karma and 30 days on your account to post here. However this is mainly to stop new accounts from spamming/posting NSFW. Feel free to come back and tell us how bad E Barbs are when you have met the requirements. ASK MODS TO BE APPROVED, THIS WILL BYPASS THIS
