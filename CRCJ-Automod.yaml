comment: "There was an old lady walking with her grandkids at the store and it kind of reminded me of the witch with her skeletons. In my head I was thinking how satisfying it would be to drop an mk to insta-kill all those skellys and take care of the witch after. Is it normal or should I get help?"

comment: BOOM ARENA IS NOT THE NEW CLASH ROYAL!! Intellectual theft is still THEFT! By playing this game you are literally stealing money and food away from supercell family mouths. If I had my way with every Boom Arena player would be charged with felony burgalry and spend 60 years in federal, fked in the butt**, prison!!!!

comment: "I think I am sexually attracted to B-rad. He is the most handsome and sexy Clash Royale YouTuber. His videos are so entertaining I could watch them all day. I could jerk off to his voice. Oh, how it's so hot. He is without a doubt my favorite YouTuber of all. His content is so unique and creative and I wish I could watch his videos forever. Whenever I see his face I get turned on and I get really hard. I wish I could meet him in real life so I could cuddle with him on my bed. We would take turns beating our meats with my massager. I know I won't be able to meet you in real life, but I just want to tell you I love you with a burning passion. Please respond to me at the very least so I have something to beat my meat about. I am your number 1 biggest fan and I hope you know that. Leave your wife and go out with me. I love you B-rad."

   "Holy shit i want to pound the shit out of the archer queen asshole. I just get so hard looking at her. I would let her shoot arrows into my dick hole and have her cut my dick off and smush it into a soup and make me drink it just to get a little nibble of her pinkie toe. I literally cannot sleep because i just cant stop jerking my dick to her. Holy shit i think already i busted 20 times while writing this. She is just so fucking hot. I cant go to school without having to jerk off in the bathroom. I have to do my homework while jerking off. I get cum all over my paper.


   I have done countless cum tributes to archer queen, i even have a fan game where you fuck her until she dies. I want her to come out of clash royale and just stomp my dick into the ground. I would be her toilet forever if i could just see her dirty stinky feet and make her rub it all over my face. I am a pig and her feet are piles of mud. I cant play my favorite game Clash Royale because every time she spawns I instantly cum everywhere. I try to hold it back but i cant. I would suck every goblins dick in the goblin gang just to have her shit stained feet be rubbed all over my dick and my face.


   Holy shit i don't know how much longer i can go anymore. I used to have my girlfriend dress up as the archer queen and have her shit all over me while jerking my dick with her stinky feet but it just wouldn't be the same. She broke up with me and now i have no one to cosplay as the archer queen. At least my archer queen flesh light is still with me.


   I seriously think about just killing that stupid barbarian king. He is getting to fuck her every minute while im here with a dick drenched in cum. I fucking hate him. He gets to lick her feet. **I DON'T.** This is not fair. I will smash his skull into the ground and take the archer queen and have her queef all over me. I would never shower again to keep the smell of her queefs on me. I would cut off the archer queens feet so i could turn it into a flesh light and have it jerk me off every second of my life. God it would be so hot. Just her stinky little piggies rubbing all over my cock. I would be the hog, and her feet would be the rider."

body: "bm"
comment: "Should i uninstall Clash Royale? Currently, I'm stuck at 1600 trophies with no deck building skills and a knock off hog 2.6 cycle i got off someone in this subreddit. Almost every single round i lose and i get bmed, even when I'm being a normal player. The game has started to affect my mental health, my day was perfectly fine before i laid on my bed and opened Clash Royale. Every time i get bmed theres no f2p emote that tell the opponent that he's being excessively toxic, not even a text that asks 'why'. And then i start to think negatively about myself and have suicidal thoughts. The only reason i want to keep this app installed is because it is a part of the clash universe. I feel like i cannot play clash of clans without having this game with it too."

comment: "I'm shaking. I'm fucking shaking. I’ve never wanted to breed with anything more than I want to with Sparky. That perfect, curvy body. Those bountiful coils. The child-bearing chassis of a literal goddess. It honestly fucking hurts knowing that I'll never mate with her, pass my genes through her, and have her birth a set of perfect Zappies. I'd do fucking ANYTHING for the chance to get Sparky pregnant. A N Y THIN G. And the fact that I can't is quite honestly too much to fucking bear. Why would Supercell create something so perfect? To fucking tantalize us? Fucking laugh in our faces?! Honestly guys, I just fucking can't anymore. Fuck. - Bounding_Bandit"

body: ["fell off"]
Comment: "Can you sympathize with the fact that none of this sub is what it used to be? You get more bad than good by keeping this bot up. People spending their time on this app just to comment “archer queen” for a smidge of a reply from you is just ludicrous. Slaves shackled to their entitlement, a million paths but choosing the wrong one everyone else is. What, because it’s funny? Because it’s getting them attention? Neither, but that nobody is willing think for themselves. But it’s never going to stop. You know it only gets worse from here. Let it go back to what it used to be, and sacrifice 10 lines of code for the greater good. We cannot let these things persist forever, or this subreddit will shed its last remaining soldiers to be transfused into the mind of the collective instead of the individual."

body: "valkyrie"
Comment: "How do I begin?! Evolution Valkyrie, my love. Her looks doesn't just make my dick hard as stone, she makes my dick hard as fucking titanium. I literally haven't slept in 2 days just because I cant stop jerking it off to her, I think I busted 69 times to her just to show my love. Every time I deploy her in the arena and I her beautiful battle cry, it's makes me cum everywhere, my body feeling the need to circle jerk (CRCJ reference). That would be one desire I have: to be the one she dominates, the reason for her unstoppable love. I wish that someday she uses her axe to create a tornado and give me head. I wish that I could take her to my arena (the bed of course). I wish that I can pound her thicc ass.


I should even make a 10 hour animated video where she pounds someone until he dies. I want her to come out of Clash Royale and drink all of the sperm in my 2 liter jar, filled with all of my cum tributes. I want her to sit on me until she crushes my skull. I am all but a chair to her glorious backside. I would get pounded by 10 Hog Riders just to get a taste of her milk. I have even sent billions of dollars to Supercell just so she can be real. 


Every time I play Clash Royale the stupid fucking Hog Rider keeps getting pulled towards her, but the stupid dummy keeps running away from her and trying to attack the towers. If I were him, I would accept my fate and let her crush me with her axe. I am the sparky to her rocket"

body: "dagger duchess"
Comment: "A way to bring dagger duchess usage back up:


Dagger duchess usage is way down since the nerf and i’ve been thinking of ways to have players use her more since supercell spent so much time creating her. I was thinking since she throws daggers so fast and has to reload so fast too maybe the more times she throws her daggers and reloads she starts getting really hot and sweaty. She starts getting so hot and sweaty she gets covered in sweat, and as the game goes on she can do stuff like take her shoes off and start taking off her clothes so she can cool off. Since Clash Royale is set in medieval times nobody has deodorant so as she gets sweatier she also gets really stinky especially under her armpits and if you play goblins near your dagger duchess tower maybe they cant help themselves and climb up the tower and smell her super stinky sweaty arm pits I think this would be a good way for supercell to sell more dagger duchess bundles and help up her usage rate."

   message: UH OH! Greedy Cash Royale mods require you have a total of 70 karma and 30 days on your account to post here. However this is mainly to stop new accounts from spamming/posting NSFW. Feel free to come back and tell us how bad E Barbs are when you have met the requirements. ASK MODS TO BE APPROVED, THIS WILL BYPASS THIS
